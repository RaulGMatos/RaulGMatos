            <p class="lead">Use Visual Basic to create an interface that allows users to see information on songs, play an excerpt of them, and purchase selected ones.
            <ul>
                <li>Use FileGet to read the information on five tunes from a structured file named music.dat into an array.</li>
                <li>Allow users to use command buttons to navigate and view information on any of the tunes.</li>
                <li>Allow users to click the Play button to play an excerpt of the tune (approximately 25 seconds long) and click the Stop button, if they wish to stop playing the excerpt before it ends.</li>
                <li>Allow users to click the Purchase button to buy the indicated tune.</li>
                <li>Users cannot checkout if they have not purchased any tunes, however they can exit the program.</li>
                <li>Use an InputBox so that users can enter their sales tax rate. Since users are entering a value, you must perform data validation on their input.</li>
                <li>Allow users to cancel the checkout process by clicking the InputBox Cancel button.</li>
                <li>When the input box is displayed, the textbox should have the focus, and when an incorrect tax value is added, the incorrect value should be cleared and the textbox should have focus again.</li>
                <li>Use Write/Writeline to create a purchase order text file named PurchaseOrder.txt that includes the date the file was created and an itemized list of purchases, the subtotal, tax, and total.</li>
                <li>Your data validation should include checking for non-numerical input and a range check.</li>
